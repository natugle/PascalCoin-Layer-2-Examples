# PascalCoin-Layer-2-Examples
Simple examples on how to develop PascalCoin Layer-2 Applications

This is a very simple example to show how to send or receive data in the Pascal network
using JSON-RPC calls to the build in server.

All operations are saved in the blockchain

See PIP-0033: DATA operation RPC implementation

More examples will be added in the future
